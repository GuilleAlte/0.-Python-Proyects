Hello! Welcome...

In this repository, I place some of my python projects from my "Master of Science in Data Science & Big Data". 

My objective is to show my knowledge and to share my code with others in case it helps!

I will bring around 15 projects in the next few days.

I believe this is a fine Repository to look at if you are starting to study Data Science or Python, as well as if you are looking for ideas. You will notice that each project will bring new thematics and complexity of state-of-the-art techniques in Data Science. In the first projects, the code will be explained, and little by little markdowns will stop describing what has been described before and the code will speak for itself.

Please feel free to comment or to ask for any clarification.
