Hello! Welcome... in this repository I place some of my python projects from my "Master of Science in Data Science & Big Data". 

My objective is to show my knowledge and to share my code with others in case it helps!

I believe this is a fine Repository to look at if you are studying Data Science or Python, as well as if you are looking for ideas. You will notice that each project will bring new thematics and complexity of state-of-the-art techniques in Data Science.
