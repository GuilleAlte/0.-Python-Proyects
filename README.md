Hello! Welcome... in this repository I place some of my python projects.

My objective is to show my knowledge and to share my code with others in case it helps!

I believe this is a fine Repository to look at if you are studying Data Science or Python, as well as if you are looking for ideas. You will notice that each project will bring new thematics and complexity of state-of-the-art techniques in Data Science.

You will find:
-Linear Regression, different normalizations, MSE, MAE
-Exploratory Data Analysis (with visualisations)
-Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms, ROC
-One Hot Encoding, Softmax Regressin 
-Silhouette score & Elbow Method
-K-Means, PCA
-Diffeerent types of Decision Trees and Classifiers
-Neural Networks (RNN)
-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
-Recomender Systems
 and more...

... and PNL is coming ;)
