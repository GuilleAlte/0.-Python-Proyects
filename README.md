Hello! Welcome... in this repository I place some of **my python projects.**

This is a **good Repository to look at if you are studying Data Science or Python**, as well as if you are looking for ideas. You will notice that each project will bring new thematics and complexity of **state-of-the-art techniques** in Data Science.

## You will find:
- Linear Regression, different normalisations, MSE, MAE
- Exploratory Data Analysis (with visualisations)
- Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms, ROC
- One Hot Encoding, Softmax Regression 
- Silhouette score & Elbow Method
- K-Means, PCA
- Different types of Decision Trees and Classifiers
- Neural Networks (RNN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
-  Recommender Systems
 and more...

... and PNL is coming :D
